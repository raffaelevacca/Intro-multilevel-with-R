This book introduces you to R, RStudio, and the tidyverse, a collection of R packages designed to work together to make data science fast, fluent, and fun. Suitable for readers with no previous programming experience, R for Data Science is designed to get you doing data science as quickly as possible.Authors Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund guide you through the steps of importing, wrangling, exploring, and modeling your data and communicating the results. You’ll get a complete, big-picture understanding of the data science cycle, along with basic tools you need to manage the details. Each section of the book is paired with exercises to help you practice what you’ve learned along the way.You’ll learn how to:Wrangle—transform your datasets into a form convenient for analysisProgram—learn powerful R tools for solving data problems with greater clarity and easeExplore—examine your data, generate hypotheses, and quickly test themModel—provide a low-dimensional summary that captures true "signals" in your datasetCommunicate—learn R Markdown for integrating prose, code, and results},

Multilevel modelling is now the accepted statistical technique for handling such data and is widely available in computer software packages. A thorough understanding of these techniques is therefore important for all those working in these areas. This new edition of Multilevel Statistical Models brings these techniques together, starting from basic ideas and illustrating how more complex models are derived. Bayesian methodology using MCMC has been extended along with new material on smoothing models, multivariate responses, missing data, latent normal transformations for discrete responses, structural equation modeling and survival models.  Key Features:  Provides a clear introduction and a comprehensive account of multilevel models. New methodological developments and applications are explored. Written by a leading expert in the field of multilevel methodology. Illustrated throughout with real-life examples, explaining theoretical concepts.  This book is suitable as a comprehensive text for postgraduate courses, as well as a general reference guide. Applied statisticians in the social sciences, economics, biological and medical disciplines will find this book beneficial.},

The lmerTest package extends the 'lmerMod' class of the lme4 package, by overloading the anova and summary functions by providing p values for tests for fixed effects. We have implemented the Satterthwaite's method for approximating degrees of freedom for the t and F tests. We have also implemented the construction of Type I - III ANOVA tables. Furthermore, one may also obtain the summary as well as the anova table using the Kenward-Roger approximation for denominator degrees of freedom (based on the KRmodcomp function from the pbkrtest package). Some other convenient mixed model analysis tools such as a step method, that performs backward elimination of nonsignificant effects  -  both random and fixed, calculation of population means and multiple comparison tests together with plot facilities are provided by the package as well.},
